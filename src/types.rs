//! This module contains all types and traits needed to represent an org file.
//!
//! The *elements* of a org file are separated into three categories:
//!
//! - [`Object`]s represent the content of the file.
//! - [`Element`]s represent the structure of the file.
//! - [`GreaterElement`] is a kind of `Element` that can contain other elements.
//!
//! # Implementation of shared behavior
//!
//! There is some shared behavior between elements an objects. This is organized into the
//! traits: [`SharedBehavior`], [`ContainsObjects`] and [`HasAffiliatedKeywords`]. Those traits
//! rely on specific data being stored in the elements/objects. To simplify this the data is
//! stored in helper traits and these helper traits are then stored in elements/objects. The
//! element/object structs only need to implement a getter method for the helper struct and the
//! trait will give them getter methods for the data in those helper structs.

/// All greater elements, elements and objects share some shared behavior.
///
/// This trait adds getters for the needed properties to the elements/objects. The following
/// properties are needed:
///
/// - **span**: Marks where in the document this element is located. Used for error/warning messages
/// - **post blank**: Blank lines and whitespace at the end of the element.
/// - **parent**: The parent element that contains this one.
///
/// The actual data is stored in the convenience struct [`SharedBehaviorData`]. The implementing
/// structs only need to implement `shared_behavior_data()` and this trait will provide the
/// getters for the fields of the `SharedBehaviorData` struct.
pub trait SharedBehavior {
    /// Returns a reference to the data of the shared behavior.
    ///
    /// You should most likely not use this method. It is just a proxy for the other methods on
    /// this trait.
    ///
    /// Wenn implementing this method you should simply return the field that stores this data.
